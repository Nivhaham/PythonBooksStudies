CSV:
CSV files are simple, lacking many of the features of an Excel spreadsheet.
• For example, CSV files
• Don’t have types for their values—everything is a string
• Don’t have settings for font size or color
• Don’t have multiple worksheets
• Can’t specify cell widths and heights
• Can’t have merged cells
• Can’t have images or charts embedded in them

The advantage of CSV files is simplicity. CSV files are widely supported
by many types of programs, can be viewed in text editors,
and are a straightforward way to represent spreadsheet data.
The CSV format is exactly as advertised: It’s just a text file of comma-separated
values.

JSON:


Many websites make their data available in JSON format. Facebook,
Twitter, Yahoo, Google, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Flickr, Data.gov, Reddit, IMDb,
Rotten Tomatoes, LinkedIn, and many other popular sites offer APIs for
programs to use. Some of these sites require registration, which is almost
always free. You’ll have to find documentation for what URLs your program
needs to request in order to get the data you want, as well as the general
format of the JSON data structures that are returned. This documentation
should be provided by whatever site is offering the API
